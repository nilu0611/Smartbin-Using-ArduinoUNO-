# Smartbin-Using-ArduinoUNO-
Under the concept of Smart City Project is created. 
The Smartbin is made with high level sensor technology,conveyer belt,servo motor and DC gear motor.
ArduinoUNO is used to create communication between hardware and software
Sensors used are:Moisture sensor,Inductive Proximity sensor,Ultrasonic sensor.
The garbage is segregated in three forms:Dry,Wet,Metal.
When the garbage is put in the prototype and conveyer starts.The object is detected using Ultrasonic sensor and Smartbin rotates using servo motor to dry part,then further Inductive sensor checks metal if yes then rotates Smartbin to metal part using servo motor,then further moisture sensor checks moisture level if it is high then Smartbin rotates to wet part using servo motor.In this way total illustration is done of project.
